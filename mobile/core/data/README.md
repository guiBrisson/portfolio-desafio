# Data Module (WIP)

This module provides the data access layer for the application, responsible for fetching, storing,
and managing data related to the news feed. It interacts with external data sources (e.g., network
API, local database) and exposes data to other modules through repositories.

## Functionality

The data module is responsible for:

* **Implementing repositories:** It defines and implements repository interfaces that provide access
  to data. These repositories abstract the underlying data sources and provide a consistent API for
  other modules to interact with data.

* **Interacting with the network API:** It utilizes the `:core:network` module to make API requests
  and retrieve data from the remote server. This involves handling network operations, parsing
  responses, and mapping them to the data models defined in the `:core:model` module.

* **TODO: Managing local data storage:** It uses a local database to cache data for offline access
  and improve performance.

* **Handling data transformations:** It includes data mappers that convert data between different
  representations, such as mapping API responses to domain models or database entities.

* **TODO: Providing error handling and caching:** It implements mechanisms for handling network
  errors, data inconsistencies, and caching strategies to optimize data access.

## Usage

Other modules, such as the UI or presentation layer, can depend on the `:core:data` module to access
data through the repository interfaces. For example, a ViewModel in the UI module can use
the `FeedRepository` to fetch feed data and display it to the user.

```kotlin
// Example usage in a ViewModel 
class FeedViewModel(private val feedRepository: FeedRepository) : ViewModel() {
  fun getG1Feed() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
      val g1Feed = feedRepository.getFeed("g1")  // Update UI with the feed data 
    }
  }
}
```

## Module Dependencies

* `:core:model`
* `:core:network`
